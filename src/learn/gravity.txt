gravity and moving object is kind of a complex topic.
one important aspect is to decouple the moving object "speed" and the frame rate.
If we change the frame rate from 30 to 60 fps the object speed need to be the same.
For this it need to be an in game time.

Another problem is the move in pixel with different resolution.
